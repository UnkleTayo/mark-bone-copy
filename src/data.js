 His humanitarian service on the pedestrian bridge has been so commendable so much that majority of people who pass the bridge give him money, which he has been using in taking care of his wife and 5 children. He is willing to keep rendering this service and has appealed to the government to see this as a means of creating job opportunities for people who though are PHYSICALLY-CHALLENGED but NOT LAZY.`,
